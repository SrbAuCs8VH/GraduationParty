## Christine Finished Her Master's!!

### Location and Time

We will be hosting it at our church. Feel free to stay the whole time or pop in just to give a hug! We will have chick-fil-a nuggets and water. Games and the prizes will be delivered after the party- so we'll get to see the winners again :)

### Food

we will only have Chick-Fil-A nuggets and water. Anyone is welcome to bring grub but it would probably be unwise to come expecting dinner. :p

### Gifts

No gifts required. Christine's love language is quality time, but if your love langauge is gifts, Chick-Fil-A, Amazon, Marshall's, and Target Gift Cards are always appreciated.
